/**
 * Suppresses the onboarding redirect a cross-plugin arms when WPForms activates it.
 *
 * Several plugins WPForms can install on the user's behalf arm a "just activated,
 * go to my onboarding" flag and consume it on `admin_init` at a priority ahead of
 * the Setup Wizard's own launch hook (`PHP_INT_MAX`), throwing the user out of our
 * onboarding and into theirs. This listener writes each plugin's opt-out flag the
 * moment WPForms activates it.
 *
 * Hooked on `wpforms_plugin_activated`, and registered by `SetupWizard::hooks()`
 * only when `RestApi::is_install_request()` says the current request is the
 * wizard's own `install-plugins` REST call. Outside that request the listener is
 * never registered, so installs from the Setup Checklist promos or the Education
 * one-click links leave each plugin's own onboarding intact — those users never
 * entered our wizard, and suppression is permanent. On this path the action fires
 * from `WPForms\Helpers\Plugin::activate()` immediately after `activate_plugin()`
 * succeeds, so a flag is never written for a plugin whose install failed.
 *
 * Suppression is permanent and never restored: WPForms' own onboarding is the one
 * the user chose, and each plugin's wizard stays reachable from its own admin menu.
 *
 * @since 2.0.1
